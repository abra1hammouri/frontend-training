                <p style="text-align: justify;"> Amid the ongoing genocide tearing lives and dreams apart in Gaza, Hadeel Abu Zaid,
                    a 29-year-old woman, stands as a symbol of resilience. She was not just a project manager at 
                    a local NGO but a spirit carrying an unwavering belief in the power of youth to bring about change,
                     dream, and reshape reality despite the surrounding destruction.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Before the war, Hadeel focused on empowering young people, helping them develop their skills, 
                    and firmly believing that their voices were the power that could transform society. She created
                     youth platforms, launched initiatives, and sowed hope in the faces of Gaza’s youth, who were 
                     exhausted by the siege.But with the war’s eruption, all visions collapsed, and dreams were 
                     buried beneath the rubble.

                Her role shifted from a project manager to someone who now shared the collective pain. She was displaced more than
                 five times, lost loved ones, and watched places she once considered safe transform into ruins. Despite all this hardship,
                  she never once thought of withdrawing. She didn’t just offer services from a safe space; she lived the same suffering,
                   the same pain, and the same fear. She was there, with the people, for them, standing alongside them.

                <li>Not a superhero—just human.</li>
                <li>Faced fear, kept going.</li>
                <li>Found hope in small moments.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Her strength wasn’t loud—it lived in silence and survival.
              Even in darkness, she chose to see light

            Hadeel recalls one harsh night: the cold was biting, the rain poured relentlessly, and the sound of bombing never stopped.
             She received a call from a woman in tears, her tent had been blown away, and she and her children were stranded in the 
             streets. All Hadeel could offer was kind words, a small tent, and her human presence.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            The woman said, "For the first time, I feel I have a sister," and in that moment, Hadeel realized that strength doesn’t 
            always come from providing solutions but from true presence and kind words that touch the hearts of those in need.
        </p>
        <h3>Her Voice in Gaza</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
           Being a woman in Gaza, the challenges she faces are multiplied.
            It wasn’t just the danger to her life, but there were other societal challenges, where sometimes
             people question or look skeptically at a woman in such roles.
